# Get Started with Mint

[Mint](https://rwx.com/mint) is a comprehensive CI/CD platform designed to move you beyond inefficient and simplistic workflows.

Mint re-envisions every step of CI/CD so that youâ€™re no longer running the same tasks over and over or combing through log files to find bugs.
Move beyond the limitations of legacy tools and code how you want with Mint.

## Step 1: Install the CLI

With Mint, you can run tasks without having to push to a git repository.
The easiest way to get started is by using the CLI to initiate runs locally.

### Mac OS

Install via homebrew:

```
brew install rwx-research/tap/mint
```

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Install via homebrew:

```
brew install rwx-research/tap/mint
```

### Linux

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/rwx-research/mint-cli/releases) on GitHub for your platform and architecture.
Move the binary into a directory on your `PATH` and make it executable.

## Step 2: Authenticate with the Mint CLI

You'll need to log in to use the CLI. To initiate the authentication process, run:

```
mint login
```

You can verify you've authenticated successfully by running:

```
mint whoami
```

## Step 3: Kick of your first Mint run

Clone this repository and run the sample-run.yml workflow. Or if you'd prefer, check out the [documentation](https://www.rwx.com/docs/mint/guides/ci) to learn how to write your own workflows.

```
git clone git@github.com:rwx-research/mint-examples.git
```
```
cd mint-examples
```
```
mint run -f .mint/sample-run.yml --title "Sample Run" --open    
```
